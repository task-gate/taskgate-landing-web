# 🌟 TaskGate — Mindful App Usage, One Task at a Time <a name="about-project"></a>

**TaskGate** is a digital wellness tool that prevents impulsive app usage.  
Instead of opening distracting apps immediately, TaskGate **intercepts the launch** and requires users to complete a short **mini-task**—such as a breathing exercise, reflection, flashcard, or a partner app’s micro-task—before granting access.

This repository contains the **TaskGate Landing Page**, built with Next.js and Firebase. It introduces TaskGate, collects waitlist sign-ups, and stores contact submissions securely.
