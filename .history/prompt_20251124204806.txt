TaskGate is an app blocker that intercepts impulsive app opens and requires the user to complete a small task before access is granted. Mini-tasks can come from TaskGate itself or from partner apps. When a partner app is selected, TaskGate opens the partner’s mini-task via an app link or universal link, and the partner app returns a “task complete” callback link to unlock the user’s original app.
